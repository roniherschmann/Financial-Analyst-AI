## 1. Project Overview
- A Python toolkit called Financial-Analyst-AI that automates retrieval, parsing, extraction, and reporting of company filings (e.g., 10-K/10-Q) from the SEC EDGAR database.

## 2. Key Features
- **Edgar fetch and summarization**: download filings via the EDGAR API and generate plain-English summaries.
- **Structured parsing and report generation**: split filings into sections like MD&A or risk factors and export customizable PDF or HTML reports.
- **Data extraction**: pull out key financial metrics (revenue, EBITDA, cash flow) and save them as CSV or JSON for further analysis.
- **Quickstart demo**: an end-to-end example script showing how to fetch, summarize, extract, and generate a report in one workflow.
