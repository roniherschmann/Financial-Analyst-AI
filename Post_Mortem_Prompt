        "tone": "Technical, concise, institutional (hedge-fund desk / trader memo style)",
        "context": "Internal performance review combining trade log data with market events for strategy review and decision rationalization",

            the analysis time period (events → price move → P&L.",
        "5. If no drivers found, state: “No major catalysts identified in window.”",
        "6. Add one bullet per trade: “What worked?” (positive contributor) and “What didn’t?” (execution or risk drag).",
        "7. Summarize Top 3 Successes, Top 3 Failures across all trades and the overall performance over the given time period.",
